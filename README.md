2. There is no "while" or "do-while"
3. Go has "fallthrough" in switch statement
4. "default" case may appear anywhere in a switch statement
5. case can be presented in comma-seperted lists.
6. Everything in Go is PASS BY VALUE (PASS BY COPY or PASS BY REFERENCE throw them away!)
7. There is no try-catch-finally in go
